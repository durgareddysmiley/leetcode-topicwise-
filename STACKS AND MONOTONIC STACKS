🧱 1. What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).
👉 The element added last is the one removed first.

Common operations:
Operation	Description
push(x)	Add element x on top of the stack
pop()	Remove the top element
peek() or top()	See the top element without removing it
isEmpty()	Check if stack is empty

⚙️ 2. What is a Monotonic Stack?

A monotonic stack is a special kind of stack where the elements are arranged in a monotonic (increasing or decreasing) order.

Operation	Description
push(x)	Add element x on top of the stack
pop()	Remove the top element

Example (using array as stack):
Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
st.push(10);
st.push(20);
st.push(30);
System.out.println(st.pop()); // Output: 30
System.out.println(st.peek()); // Output: 20
⚙️ 2. What is a Monotonic Stack?
A monotonic stack is a special kind of stack where the elements are arranged in a monotonic (increasing or decreasing) order.
It helps solve problems like:

Next Greater Element

Previous Smaller Element

Stock Span

Trapping Rain Water

Largest Rectangle in Histogram

##UNDERSTANDING 
It’s simply a normal stack used in a specific way — such that the elements inside follow a monotonic (ordered) property while solving certain problems.

🧠 LeetCode 496 — Next Greater Element I
📜 Problem Statement

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2.
If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

🧩 Example 1

Input:

nums1 = [4,1,2]
nums2 = [1,3,4,2]


Output:

[-1, 3, -1]


Explanation:

For 4 → there is no greater element to the right → -1

For 1 → next greater element is 3

For 2 → no greater element to the right → -1

##SOLUTION 
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        st = []
        an = []
        h = defaultdict(lambda:-1)
        for i in range(len(nums2)):
            while st and nums2[st[-1]] < nums2[i]:
                h[nums2[st[-1]]] = nums2[i]
                st.pop()
            st.append(i)
        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            if nums1[i] in h:
                an.append(h[nums1[i]])
            else:
                an.append(-1)
        return an

🔁 LeetCode 503 — Next Greater Element II
Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]),
return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of an element x is the first greater number to its right,
considering the array as circular.
If it doesn’t exist, return -1 for that number.

🧩 Example 1

Input:

nums = [1, 2, 1]


Output:

[2, -1, 2]


Explanation:

For the first 1, next greater is 2

For 2, there’s no greater element → -1

For the last 1, searching circularly → next greater is again 2
##SOLUTION 
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        st = []
        an = []
        r = 0
        res = [-1]*len(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)*2):
            r = i % len(nums)
            while st and nums[st[-1]] < nums[r]:
                res[st.pop()] = nums[r]
            st.append(r)
    
        return res
