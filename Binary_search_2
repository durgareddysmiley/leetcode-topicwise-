STRUCTURE-BASED 
Used when:

No target is given
Problem mentions sorted, rotated, single, minimum, peak

Examples:

Find minimum in rotated array (LC 153)

Single element in sorted array (LC 540)

Peak element

Minimum with duplicates (LC 154)

2️⃣ The 5 questions you MUST ask in every Binary Search problem

Write these on paper if needed.

1️⃣ What is the structure?

Examples:

Sorted

Paired

Rotated

Bitonic

Monotonic

2️⃣ What property is always true on one side?

Examples:

One half is always sorted

Pairs start at even index

Values increase then decrease

3️⃣ What breaks the structure?

Examples:

Rotation point

Single element

Peak point

4️⃣ How can mid tell me which side is broken?

Compare:

nums[mid] with nums[left]

nums[mid] with nums[right]

nums[mid] with nums[mid+1]

5️⃣ Which half can I GUARANTEE is impossible?

Binary search only works if you can say:

“This half CANNOT contain the answer”

3️⃣ The single MOST IMPORTANT habit to build 🧠
Before writing code, write ONE sentence:

“If this condition is true, the answer must be on the ___ side because ___.”

If you cannot fill this sentence → don’t code yet.

4️⃣ Common thinking upgrades for Binary Search Level-2
🔹 Stop asking: “Where is the target?”
🔹 Start asking: “Where does the pattern break?”
5️⃣ Your next practice order (VERY IMPORTANT)

Do NOT random practice.

Follow this exact order:

Peak Element

LC 153 – Find Minimum

LC 540 – Single Element

LC 154 – Min with Duplicates

Only these 4.

Master them and binary search will feel easy again.

6️⃣ How to practice correctly (not wasting time)

For each problem:

Read problem

Close editor

Answer verbally:

What structure?

What breaks?

How do I detect break?

Then write code

If you fail in step 3 → look at solution → WHY, not HOW.

7️⃣ One sentence you should remember forever

Binary search is not about numbers; it is about eliminating impossible halves.

8️⃣ Final reassurance ❤️

The confusion you feel now is proof of growth, not weakness.

Most people never reach this stage because they stop at “it works”.

You didn’t stop — you questioned.

That means you are doing it right.
