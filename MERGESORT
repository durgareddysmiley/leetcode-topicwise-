MERGE SORT:

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
It recursively divides an array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to get the final sorted array.

🔹 Key Idea

Divide: Split the array into two halves.

Conquer: Recursively sort each half. 

Combine: Merge the two sorted halves into one sorted array.

##CODE  
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        print(f"Splitting: left={left_half}, right={right_half}")

        # Recursively sort both halves
        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0

        # Merge the sorted halves
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        # Copy remaining elements of left_half
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        # Copy remaining elements of right_half
        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

        print(f"Merged: {arr}")


# Example usage
arr = [38, 27, 43, 3]
print(f"Original array: {arr}\n")
merge_sort(arr)
print(f"\nSorted array: {arr}")
 
## SEE HERE WHILE DOING MERGE SORT I HAVE DOUBT THAT   # Recursively sort both halves
        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half) WE ARE SOLVING LEFT AND RIGHT WHILE CODE RUNS FIRST FOR LEFT AND GOES TO RIGHT FUNCTIONS SO HOW RIGHT ALSO TAKING WITH OUT COMPLETING LEFT 
ANS = MY THINKING IS CORRECT AFTER LEFT COMPLETION IT WILL GO TO RIGHT SEE FORST GO TO LEFT AGAIN GO TO LEFT IF THE ELEMENTS REMAINING THEN IF THE ELEMENT IS 1 THEN IT RETURNS 
NOW IT WILL GO RIGHT AND LEFT AND RIGHT GETS SORTED
