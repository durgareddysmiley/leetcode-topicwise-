🔹 BIT MASKING (MOST IMPORTANT NEXT TOPIC)

Bit masking means using bits to control / check values.

We’ll follow this exact format again:

What → Example → Where to use

1️⃣ TURN ON (SET) A BIT
👉 What it means

Make a particular bit 1, no matter what.

Example

Turn ON bit at position 2 (0-based index)

n = 0
mask = 1 << 2
n = n | mask
print(n)


Binary:

1 << 2 = 100
0 | 100 = 100


Result:

4

Where to use?

Enable features

Permissions

Flags

2️⃣ CHECK IF A BIT IS ON
👉 What it means

Check whether a particular bit is 1 or 0.

Example

Check bit at position 2

n = 4      # 100
mask = 1 << 2

if n & mask:
    print("Bit is ON")
else:
    print("Bit is OFF")

Where to use?

Permission checking

Feature enabled or not

3️⃣ TURN OFF (CLEAR) A BIT
👉 What it means

Make a particular bit 0.

Example

Turn OFF bit at position 2

n = 4      # 100
mask = ~(1 << 2)
n = n & mask
print(n)


Binary:

~100 = 011
100 & 011 = 000


Result:

0

Where to use?

Disable features

Remove permissions

4️⃣ TOGGLE A BIT
👉 What it means

If bit is 1 → make 0
If bit is 0 → make 1

Example

Toggle bit at position 2

n = 0
n = n ^ (1 << 2)
print(n)   # 4

n = n ^ (1 << 2)
print(n)   # 0

Where to use?

Switch ON/OFF

Toggle settings
