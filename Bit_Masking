🔹 BIT MASKING (MOST IMPORTANT NEXT TOPIC)

Bit masking means using bits to control / check values.

We’ll follow this exact format again:

What → Example → Where to use

1️⃣ TURN ON (SET) A BIT
👉 What it means

Make a particular bit 1, no matter what.

Example

Turn ON bit at position 2 (0-based index)

n = 0
mask = 1 << 2
n = n | mask
print(n)


Binary:

1 << 2 = 100
0 | 100 = 100



Result:

4

Where to use?

Enable features

Permissions

Flags

2️⃣ CHECK IF A BIT IS ON
👉 What it means

Check whether a particular bit is 1 or 0.

Example

Check bit at position 2

n = 4      # 100
mask = 1 << 2

if n & mask:
    print("Bit is ON")
else:
    print("Bit is OFF")

Where to use?

Permission checking

Feature enabled or not

3️⃣ TURN OFF (CLEAR) A BIT
👉 What it means

Make a particular bit 0.

Example

Turn OFF bit at position 2

n = 4      # 100
mask = ~(1 << 2)
n = n & mask
print(n)


Binary:

~100 = 011
100 & 011 = 000


Result:

0

Where to use?

Disable features

Remove permissions

4️⃣ TOGGLE A BIT
👉 What it means

If bit is 1 → make 0
If bit is 0 → make 1

Example

Toggle bit at position 2

n = 0
n = n ^ (1 << 2)
print(n)   # 4

n = n ^ (1 << 2)
print(n)   # 0

Where to use?

Switch ON/OFF

Toggle settings

🔥 BIT MANIPULATION QUICK REVISION (WHEN & WHERE TO USE)
1️⃣ AND (&) — CHECK / REMOVE
✅ WHEN to use &

When you want to CHECK a bit

When you want to REMOVE a bit

When you want to filter bits

📌 WHERE to use
n & 1


👉 Check odd / even

n & (1 << i)


👉 Check ith bit is 1 or not

n & (n - 1)


👉 Remove rightmost set bit

n & ~(1 << i)


👉 Clear ith bit

2️⃣ OR (|) — SET
✅ WHEN to use |

When you want to SET a bit to 1

When you want to keep existing 1s

📌 WHERE to use
n | 1


👉 Set last bit

n | (1 << i)


👉 Set ith bit

n | (n + 1)


👉 Set rightmost unset (0) bit

3️⃣ XOR (^) — TOGGLE / UNIQUE
✅ WHEN to use ^

When you want to TOGGLE a bit

When duplicates exist and only one is unique

📌 WHERE to use
n ^ 1


👉 Toggle last bit

n ^ (1 << i)


👉 Toggle ith bit

a ^ a = 0
a ^ 0 = a


👉 Used in Single Number problems

4️⃣ LEFT SHIFT (<<) — MOVE LEFT / MULTIPLY
✅ WHEN to use <<

When you want to create a bit mask

When you want to multiply by 2

📌 WHERE to use
1 << i


👉 Mask for ith bit

n << 1


👉 Multiply n by 2

5️⃣ RIGHT SHIFT (>>) — MOVE RIGHT / DIVIDE
✅ WHEN to use >>

When you want to divide by 2

When you want to check bits one by one

📌 WHERE to use
n >> 1


👉 Divide by 2

(n >> i) & 1


👉 Check ith bit
