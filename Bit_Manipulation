🔹 What is Bit Manipulation?

Bit manipulation means working with numbers in binary (0 and 1) using special operators.

👉 Computer does NOT understand 10, 20, 50
👉 Computer understands only 0 and 1

So bit manipulation =
playing with 0s and 1s to solve problems faster

🔹 What is a BIT?

A bit is the smallest unit of data

Bit → 0 or 1


Examples:

5 in binary = 101
8 in binary = 1000

🔹 Why learn Bit Manipulation?

Because:

Faster solutions 🚀

Used in LeetCode, HackerRank, exams

Used in DSA, OS, networking

🔹 Binary Numbers (VERY IMPORTANT)
Decimal	Binary
1	1
2	10
3	11
4	100
5	101
6	110
7	111
8	1000

👉 Every number = sum of powers of 2

Example:

5 = 4 + 1
  = 100 + 001
  = 101

🔹 Bitwise Operators (MAIN THING)
1️⃣ AND (&)

👉 Both bits must be 1

1 & 1 = 1
1 & 0 = 0
0 & 0 = 0


Example:

5 & 3
5 = 101
3 = 011
---------
    001 = 1

##IT IS USED TO CHECK EVEN OR ODD 
3️⃣ Example (VERY CLEAR)
Example 1: EVEN number
6 & 1


Binary:

6 = 110
1 = 001


AND:

110
001
---
000  → 0


✅ Result = 0 → EVEN

n = 7

if n & 1:
    print("Odd")
else:
    print("Even")


2️⃣ OR (|)

👉 If any one is 1, result is 1

1 | 0 = 1
0 | 0 = 0


Example:

5 | 3
101
011
---
111 = 7

##WHEN IT IS USED 
USED TO CHECK AT LEAST THERE IS 1 
✅ Use Case 1: TURN ON A BIT (MOST IMPORTANT)

OR is used to set / turn ON a bit.

Example:

x = 4      # 100
x = x | 1  # turn ON last bit


Binary:

100 | 001 = 101


Result:

5


👉 Used in bit masking
3️⃣ XOR (^) ⭐ IMPORTANT

👉 Same → 0
👉 Different → 1

1 ^ 1 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1


Example:

5 ^ 3
101
011
---
110 = 6 

2️⃣ Important Properties (VERY IMPORTANT ⭐)
a ^ a = 0        → same number cancels
a ^ 0 = a        → XOR with 0 gives same number
a ^ b ^ a = b    → order does not matter

3️⃣ Why XOR Removes Duplicates?

Duplicate numbers appear twice

XOR of same numbers becomes 0

So duplicates cancel each other

Only the single number remains

Example:

[2, 3, 2]
→ (2 ^ 2) ^ 3
→ 0 ^ 3
→ 3

##WHEN IT IS NOT USED 
IF THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE SINGLE ELEMENT IN THE ARRAY COR IS NOT USE FULL

5️⃣ Python Code (Exam Ready)
ans = 0
for x in nums:
    ans ^= x
print(ans)

🔹 SHIFT OPERATORS — SHORT NOTES

There are 2 types:
1️⃣ Left Shift <<
2️⃣ Right Shift >>

1️⃣ LEFT SHIFT (<<)
👉 What it does

Shifts bits to the LEFT

Adds 0 at the right end

Multiplies the number by 2

🔹 Rule (IMPORTANT ⭐)
n << k = n × (2^k)

🔹 Example 1
5 << 1

here  n = 5 , k= 1 
2 * 1 = 2 
now 5 * 2 = 10

Binary:

5 = 101
→ 1010


Decimal:

1010 = 10


✅ Result:

5 << 1 = 10

🔹 Example 2
6 << 2


Binary:

6 = 110
→ 11000


Decimal:

11000 = 24


✅ Result:

6 << 2 = 24

🔹 When to use <<

Fast multiplication

n * 2 → n << 1

n * 4 → n << 2

🔹 WHERE TO USE LEFT SHIFT (<<)
1️⃣ When multiplying by power of 2

Use left shift when multiplication is:

×2, ×4, ×8, ×16, ...

Example:
n = 5
n << 1   # 5 × 2 = 10
n << 2   # 5 × 4 = 20
n << 3   # 5 × 8 = 40


👉 Used when * is not allowed.

🔹 RIGHT SHIFT (>>)
1️⃣ What is Right Shift?

👉 Moves binary bits to the RIGHT
👉 Removes the last bit
👉 Divides the number by 2 (integer division)

2️⃣ Example (VERY CLEAR)
Example 1
10 >> 1


Binary:

10 = 1010


Right shift by 1:

1010 → 101


Decimal:

101 = 5


✅ Result:

10 >> 1 = 5

3️⃣ Where to Use Right Shift?
✅ Use Case 1: Divide by Power of 2

When question says:

Divide without using /

n >> 1  →  n ÷ 2
n >> 2  →  n ÷ 4
n >> 3  →  n ÷ 8
