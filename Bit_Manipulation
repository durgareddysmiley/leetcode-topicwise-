🔹 What is Bit Manipulation?

Bit manipulation means working with numbers in binary (0 and 1) using special operators.

👉 Computer does NOT understand 10, 20, 50
👉 Computer understands only 0 and 1

So bit manipulation =
playing with 0s and 1s to solve problems faster

🔹 What is a BIT?

A bit is the smallest unit of data

Bit → 0 or 1


Examples:

5 in binary = 101
8 in binary = 1000

🔹 Why learn Bit Manipulation?

Because:

Faster solutions 🚀

Used in LeetCode, HackerRank, exams

Used in DSA, OS, networking

🔹 Binary Numbers (VERY IMPORTANT)
Decimal	Binary
1	1
2	10
3	11
4	100
5	101
6	110
7	111
8	1000

👉 Every number = sum of powers of 2

Example:

5 = 4 + 1
  = 100 + 001
  = 101

🔹 Bitwise Operators (MAIN THING)
1️⃣ AND (&)

👉 Both bits must be 1

1 & 1 = 1
1 & 0 = 0
0 & 0 = 0


Example:

5 & 3
5 = 101
3 = 011
---------
    001 = 1

2️⃣ OR (|)

👉 If any one is 1, result is 1

1 | 0 = 1
0 | 0 = 0


Example:

5 | 3
101
011
---
111 = 7

3️⃣ XOR (^) ⭐ IMPORTANT

👉 Same → 0
👉 Different → 1

1 ^ 1 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1


Example:

5 ^ 3
101
011
---
110 = 6
