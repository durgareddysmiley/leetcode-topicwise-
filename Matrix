📘 MATRIX – COMPLETE FOUNDATION NOTES (BEGINNER)
1️⃣ What is a Matrix?

A matrix is a 2D collection of values arranged in:

Rows

Columns

Example:

1  2  3
4  5  6


This is a 2 × 3 matrix
(2 rows, 3 columns)

👉 In code:

Python → list of lists

Java → 2D array

2️⃣ Why do we use Matrix?

We use matrix when data naturally fits in rows & columns.

Real-life reasons:
Situation	Why Matrix
Student marks	Student × Subject
Images	Pixels × Pixels
Games	Board / Grid
Tables	Rows & Columns
Maps	Coordinates

👉 1D array is not enough when:

You need row + column relation

You need grid-based data

3️⃣ Matrix vs Array (VERY IMPORTANT)
Array (1D)	Matrix (2D)
One direction	Two directions
arr[i]	mat[i][j]
Simple list	Table / grid
Linear problems	Grid problems

👉 If problem mentions:

rows

columns

grid

table

board

➡️ Use matrix

4️⃣ How Matrix is Stored in Code?
Python:
mat = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6]
]

👉 Access:

mat[row][col]

5️⃣ Types of Matrices (Only What You NEED)
🔹 Row Matrix

1 row, many columns

1 2 3

🔹 Column Matrix

Many rows, 1 column

1
2
3

🔹 Square Matrix

Rows = Columns

1 2
3 4

🔹 Identity Matrix

Diagonal = 1, rest = 0

1 0
0 1

🔹 Zero Matrix

All elements = 0

👉 In coding interviews:

Square matrix is MOST common

6️⃣ Basic Matrix Operations (Must Know)
Operation	Meaning
Traversal	Visit each element
Row-wise	Row by row
Column-wise	Column by column
Diagonal	i == j
Transpose	Swap rows & columns
Sum	Row / column / diagonal sum

7️⃣ Why So Many Matrix Questions in Interviews?

Because matrix tests:

Index handling

Loop control

Logical thinking

Boundary conditions

👉 One small mistake = wrong output
So interviewers love matrix 😄

8️⃣ Common Matrix Question Types
🔸 Basic

Print matrix

Sum of rows / columns

Max / min element

🔸 Traversal

Zig-zag

Spiral

Snake pattern

🔸 Diagonal

Main diagonal sum

Secondary diagonal sum

🔸 Advanced

Prefix sum

Block sum

Matrix multiplication

9️⃣ How You Should THINK Before Solving Matrix Problems

Always ask:

1️⃣ How many rows?
2️⃣ How many columns?
3️⃣ Which direction to move?
4️⃣ Which index changes? i or j
5️⃣ Any condition like i == j?

👉 Thinking > Coding

🔟 When NOT to use Matrix?

❌ If data is single line
❌ If no row-column relation
❌ If order doesn’t matter

Then → use array / list

##DOUBT 
🔟 When NOT to use Matrix?

❌ If data is single line
❌ If no row-column relation
❌ If order doesn’t matter
IF ONE CONDITION IS FLSE WE DO NOT USE MTRIX 
## ORDER DOESNT MTTERS MENS 10. 20, 30 WE ARE CARING THAT 30 IS AT INDEX 2 WHEN WE ARE NOT CARING ABOUT THAT JUST STORING NUMBERS THEN WE DONT USE MATRIX ORDER DOESNT CARE MEANS WHAT
