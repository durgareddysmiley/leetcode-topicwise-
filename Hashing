HASHING:
     hashing is used to count frequencis   
METHODS   
1. Hash Table (dict) 
 
Definition:
A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows fast access, insertion, and deletion using a hash function.

Example Code:  
 
# Hash table example
ht = {"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30}  # key → value
print(ht["Alice"])             # 25    
ht["Charlie"] = 35             # Add new key-value
print(ht)                       # {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 30, 'Charlie': 35}

2. Hash Set (set)

Definition:
A hash set is a data structure that stores unique elements and allows fast membership checks, insertion, and deletion using hashing.

Example Code:

# Hash set example
hs = {1, 2, 3}    # unique elements
hs.add(4)         # add element
print(3 in hs)    # True
print(hs)         # {1, 2, 3, 4}

## REMOVE AND DELETE 
IF WE NEED TO REMOVE LAST ONE IN THE LIST THEN WE CAN JUST WRITE JUST A.POP()
POP IS USED FOR REMOVING LAST VALUE AND DELETING THROUGH INDEX
## IF WE NEED TO REMOVE A SPECIC VALUE USE LIKE A.REMOVE[S[4]] LIKE THAT
