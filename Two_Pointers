## Easy

### 876. Middle of the Linked List
**Problem:** Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node.  
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.  

**Example 1:**  
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]


**Solution (Python Example):**
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow

### 2095 . Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List
**Problem:** You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node and return the head of the modified linked list.  

The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing.  
- For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, 2 respectively.

**Examples:**  

**Example 1:**  
Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        prev = None
        if head.next == None:
            return None
        while fast and fast.next:
            prev = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        prev.next = slow.next
        return head

🔥 TWO POINTERS IN LINKED LIST (ONLY 3 TYPES)
🧠 Rule to remember

Two pointers ≠ one logic
Two pointers = 3 different patterns

1️⃣ SPEED DIFFERENCE PATTERN
(Fast = 2 steps, Slow = 1 step)
👉 Used for:

Find middle

Detect cycle

🧠 When to use?

Question says:

middle

cycle

half

✅ BASIC TEMPLATE
slow = fast = head

while fast and fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next

# slow is middle OR meet point

2️⃣ FIXED DISTANCE PATTERN ⭐ (IMPORTANT)
(Fast starts first, Slow follows)
👉 Used for:

Nth node from end

Kth node from last

Remove from end

🧠 When to use?

Question says:

from end

last k

one pass

✅ BASIC TEMPLATE
slow = fast = head

# create distance
for _ in range(k):
    fast = fast.next

# move together
while fast:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next

# slow is answer

3️⃣ MEET / COMPARE PATTERN
(Two pointers meet or compare)
👉 Used for:

Palindrome linked list

Intersection of two lists

🧠 When to use?

Question says:

palindrome

intersection

✅ BASIC TEMPLATE
p1 = head1
p2 = head2

while p1 != p2:
    p1 = p1.next if p1 else head2
    p2 = p2.next if p2 else head1

return p1

🧠 ONE-LINE MEMORY (PUT IN GITHUB README)
Two Pointer Linked List:

1) Speed diff → middle, cycle
2) Distance diff → from end problems
3) Meet/compare → palindrome, intersection

🧠 SUPER SHORT DECISION RULE (EXAM)

Ask only one question:

❓ Does problem mention END / LAST?
➡ use distance pattern

❓ Does it mention MIDDLE / CYCLE?
➡ use speed pattern

❓ Does it mention MATCH / PALINDROME?
➡ use meet pattern
