What is Greedy Algorithm (from zero)

👉 Greedy = take the best option right now, hoping it leads to the final best answer.

You don’t think about future

You don’t try all possibilities

You decide step by step, locally best choice

📌 One-line definition for exams

A Greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each step to reach a globally optimal solution.

✅ Use GREEDY when:

Local best choice always leads to global best

Once you make a choice, you never regret it

The problem says:

maximum profit

minimum time

earliest finish

largest value first

Sorting + one pass works

📌 Examples:

Activity Selection

Fractional Knapsack

Minimum platforms

Huffman coding

❌ Greedy FAILS when:

Two or more smaller choices together beat one big choice

Current decision affects future options

You need to try all combinations

➡️ This is where DP comes in.

🧠 YOUR EXAMPLE (Target = 12)

Let’s use it properly 👇

Case 1️⃣ Greedy WORKS
coins = [1, 5, 10]
target = 12

Greedy:
10 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins ✅


Here:

No combination of small coins beats 10

Local choice is safe
➡️ Greedy OK

Case 2️⃣ Greedy FAILS
coins = [1, 6, 7]
target = 12

Greedy:
7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 coins ❌

Better:
6 + 6 = 2 coins ✅


📌 Two small > one big
➡️ DP REQUIRED

🚨 MOST IMPORTANT SIGNAL (THIS IS GOLD)

🔔 If you can form the target in multiple ways and
🔔 you must compare them
👉 Use DP

Coin Change, Subset Sum, Partition → ALL DP

🔑 When does Greedy work?

Greedy works ONLY when the problem has this property:

Choosing the best option now will NOT spoil the final answer.

If wrong choice now can’t be fixed later ❌ → Greedy fails
If wrong choice never happens ✔️ → Greedy works

## WHEN GREEDY FAILS 
Step 2️⃣: Convert the problem so GREEDY FAILS
❌ Change the coin set

Let’s change it to:

{1, 3, 4}


⚠️ Only this change is enough
Problem statement remains SAME:

Given infinite supply of coins {1, 3, 4}, find minimum number of coins for n.

Step 3️⃣: Show GREEDY FAILING (Very important)
Take n = 6
Greedy thinking (wrong)
Take 4 → remaining 2
Take 1 → remaining 1
Take 1 → remaining 0
Total coins = 3

Optimal solution (better)
3 + 3 = 6
Total coins = 2


❌ Greedy failed
✔️ Optimal used fewer coins

Step 4️⃣: WHY greedy failed here (Key intuition)

Because:

Coin 4 looks attractive locally

But 3 + 3 is globally better

📌 Greedy got trapped by a local optimum

Step 5️⃣: Write this as an EXAM ANSWER

You can write 👇

If the coin denominations are {1, 3, 4}, greedy strategy fails.
For n = 6, greedy picks 4 first and uses 3 coins (4,1,1), whereas optimal solution uses only 2 coins (3,3).
Hence greedy does not guarantee optimal solution for all coin systems.

Step 6️⃣: General Rule to Detect Greedy FAILURE

Greedy fails when:

A larger coin blocks a better combination

Medium coins together beat a large coin

🔑 One-line rule (remember this forever)

If a coin is NOT a good replacement of smaller coins, greedy may fail.

Step 7️⃣: Another greedy-failing example

Coin set:

{1, 5, 6, 9}


n = 11

Greedy:

9 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins


Optimal:

5 + 6 = 2 coins


❌ Greedy fails again

🔥 SUPER IMPORTANT EXAM LINE

Greedy algorithm works for canonical coin systems (like Indian currency), but fails for arbitrary denominations.

🧠 How to IDENTIFY Greedy (Very Important Patterns)

These patterns appear again and again 👇
If you see them → think GREEDY

Pattern 1️⃣: Sorting + Selection

If the problem says:

maximum / minimum

select activities / jobs / intervals

based on time, profit, weight, deadline

👉 First step = SORT something

Example

Activity Selection

Job Sequencing

Minimum Platforms

📌 Clue words
start time, end time, deadline, profit, interval

🧠 Logic:

Sort → Pick best → Move forward

Pattern 2️⃣: Take the Best Ratio / Value

If problem involves:

weight & value

profit per unit

efficiency

👉 Choose maximum ratio

Example

Fractional Knapsack

📌 Formula idea (don’t panic):

value / weight


🧠 Logic:

Take the most beneficial item first

Pattern 3️⃣: Minimize something step by step

If question says:

minimum cost

minimum operations

minimum number of items

👉 At every step, pick smallest / cheapest

Example

Minimum coins

Connect ropes with minimum cost

🧠 Logic:

Small choices reduce total cost

Pattern 4️⃣: Always extend the current best

If problem says:

reach end

cover distance

jumps / refills

👉 Use current maximum reach

Example

Jump Game

Minimum refueling stops

🧠 Logic:

Go as far as possible with what you have

Pattern 5️⃣: Greedy with Frequency / Count

If problem involves:

characters

frequency

rearranging to avoid conflict

👉 Always pick most frequent / least frequent carefully

Example

Rearrange string

Task scheduling with cooldown

🧠 Logic:

Balance frequent elements first

🧩 How to Solve ANY Greedy Problem (Exam + Coding)

Use this 5-step thinking template:

What should I maximize or minimize?

What is the best choice right now?

Can I sort something?

After choosing, can I never regret?

Repeat till end

📌 If answers feel natural → Greedy is correct

❌ Common Mistake (Important)

🚫 Greedy is NOT

Recursion

DP

Try all cases

Greedy = single path, no backtracking
