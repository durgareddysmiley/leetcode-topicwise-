Binary search 
🔹 What is Binary Search? 

Definition (Interview-ready):

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space into half.

🔹 Why Binary Search is Efficient?

It does not check elements one by one

At each step, it eliminates half of the remaining elements

Works only when data is sorted or monotonic

🔹 How Binary Search Works (Brief)

Find the middle element

Compare it with the target

Decide whether to search in the left half or right half

Repeat until the element is found or the search space becomes empty

🔹 Time Complexity of Binary Search
Case	Time Complexity
Best Case	O(1) (target found at mid)
Average Case	O(log n)
Worst Case	O(log n)

in binary search patterns i am good when problems are 

Used when:

Target is given

Question says search, find index, count

Thinking:

“Is nums[mid] less than or greater than target?”

Examples:

Normal binary search

First/last occurrence

Search in rotated array (LC 33)

✅ You are already good at this. 


👉 Reason: The array size is reduced by half in every step.
