## Doubts 
When to use i < j and i <=j confusion when to use 

🟢 CASE 1: End with ONE index → i < j

Use this when:

The problem guarantees one answer exists

You keep mid sometimes (j = mid or i = mid)

You want the loop to stop when one index remains

Typical problems:

Find Minimum in Rotated Array

Find Peak Element

Minimum in Bitonic Array

Pattern:
while i < j:
    mid = (i + j) // 2
    if condition:
        i = mid + 1   # discard mid
    else:
        j = mid       # keep mid
return i

Why NOT <=?

Because when i == j, the answer is already found —
checking again causes errors or infinite loops.

🔵 CASE 2: Test ALL possible indices → i <= j

Use this when:

You remove mid completely (mid±1)

You must check the last element

The answer might be anywhere

Typical problems:

Binary Search for a target

Square root

First / last occurrence

Pattern:
while i <= j:
    mid = (i + j) // 2
    if condition:
        i = mid + 1
    else:
        j = mid - 1

🔥 SUPER IMPORTANT MEMORY LINE (LOCK THIS)

If you ever write j = mid, you MUST use i < j.
If you write j = mid - 1, you MUST use i <= j.

This rule never fails. 

## DOUBT2 WHEN TO USE i = mid + 1 and i = mid and j = mid + 1 and j = mid 
🧠 BINARY SEARCH – FINAL RULES (MEMORIZE THIS)
RULE 1️⃣ (MOST IMPORTANT)

Decide first: Can mid be the answer?

Everything depends on this.

RULE 2️⃣ (LEFT POINTER UPDATE)
❌ Use i = mid + 1

When:

mid is IMPOSSIBLE as an answer

You want to delete mid

Say in your head:

“mid is wrong → throw it away”

✅ Use i = mid

When:

mid CAN BE the answer

You want to keep mid

Say in your head:

“mid might be correct → keep it”

⚠️ Only safe with while i < j

RULE 3️⃣ (RIGHT POINTER UPDATE)
❌ Use j = mid - 1

When:

mid is IMPOSSIBLE as an answer

You want to delete mid

✅ Use j = mid

When:

mid CAN BE the answer

You want to keep mid

⚠️ Only safe with while i < j

RULE 4️⃣ (LOOP CONDITION — THIS LOCKS EVERYTHING)
🔴 If you EVER keep mid

(i = mid OR j = mid)

👉 MUST use:

while i < j

🟢 If you ALWAYS delete mid

(i = mid + 1 OR j = mid - 1)

👉 Use:

while i <= j

🔥 ONE-LOOK DECISION TABLE
Your line	Meaning	Loop
i = mid + 1	delete mid	i <= j
j = mid - 1	delete mid	i <= j
i = mid	keep mid	i < j
j = mid	keep mid	i < j
🧠 ONE SENTENCE TO REMEMBER FOREVER

Keep mid → stop at one index (i < j)
Delete mid → check all indices (i <= j)

✅ FINAL SELF-CHECK (do this every time)

Before writing code, ask:
1️⃣ Can mid be the answer?
2️⃣ If YES → keep it → i < j
3️⃣ If NO → delete it → i <= j
